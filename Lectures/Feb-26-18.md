### Virtual Worlds of the Past:An Intro to Games/History

*Immersive experience with materials*
 What will you produce for this module? Unity...
 - Twine
 - Agumented Reality 
 
**Agenda (today's lecture)**
- defining a game
- how playfulness & history intersect
- playing the past
- categorizing immersive experiences *(the ones we are used to are the ones that we see because they are cateogrized for selling purposes- helps us to highlight what is important)*
- some video game theory
- ARGs the Killer App

> *Chris Crawford: Games are... the most ancient and time-honored vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one, having received the seal of approval of natural selection.*
- Quit because how upset he was with the industry
- Games and play are important for humans to learn anout the world
- Learning through play (think about ELECT curriculum) 
- You don't see lions lecturing their young at a chalkboard
- Games always have really bad press
- ALWAYS happen after a school shooting...
- How can use games for reaching people? In the 80's and 90's the literature is mainly positive
- Post Colombine..the literature becomes mainly **negative**
- Community play (context around which playing happens) is different than the game itself
- Games are models of exterial actions (game isn't real)
  - the player has to be able to feel something
  - **Conflict:** there must be a goal 
  - **Safety:** game play is safe, carry out the full consequences of the game (aka you get shot in the game and not in real life)
  - Video games can be ethical if you have realistic consequences (better than if you can just save and come back to the game) -ethical choices
  - *Do the choices that you make matter?*
   
  **FOR HISTORIANS THESE CHOICES HAVE TO MATTER**
 - WE ARE DEALING WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF REAL HUMAN BEINGS
  
 We have to think about these things when dealing with video games
 - Mechanics 
  - (basic rules and codes)
 - Dynamics 
  - (Algorithms, play)
 - Aesthetics 
  - (emotional response provoked provoked by player)
  
 Moving away from questions to what happened to rather WHY it happened? 
 - consequences emerge out of actions
 - contingency
 - equafinality (given the circumstances a set of outcomes are probable - and if all we have is the one true outcome that happened)
     - video games give you the options to change this
     - you can have many different possibilites
 
  *the ability to **play** out a scenario and then predict or write about what is happening*
   - the immersive experience changes how you deal with the source material in the first place
   
 **Why do we play games?**
- we are always asking "what happens next"
- pleasure of finding out what is going to happen next
   
   *an inversion of tense for historians..*
  
**In many ways, the same motivation for historians:**
- What happened then?
- Why did it happen?
- To play a game successfully, the gamer has to learn why things happen the way they do in order to win
- To be a successful historian, the historian has to learn why things happened the way they did

**[Youtube Video: Romans Must Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCe5QEnoioI)**

- *Simulation is the best tool for understanding context*
 - games where the player has control 
 - they have to now make the choices and decisions in these difficult sitations
 - **simulation is not an oracle**
 - its **interpretation** 
  - an interpretation that encourages further interpretation
- authority. **(SO important)**
- authoritative gravity of *print*

***BUT WITH GAMES. We can get past this***

#### Procedural Literacy & Procedural Rhetorics
- actual mechanics of the game are far more important than the graphics 
- graphics get in the way
- concern of the authenticity
- *is the layout of the cobble accurate for 18th c Boston?*
- argument about the world are encoded in the rule sets themselves
- creating scenarios that are realistic to that time
 - empiricism 
 - making scenarios that are realistic and reflect the scenario
 
**What (historical) games have you played?/ What made them historical?/ What made them good?**
- COD, Valiant Hearts
- Very few games about WWI
 - Harder to find out who the bad guys are 
- Far Cry Primal

**Ludology:**
- The study of games. Also: The study of games as a unique field, especially as distinct from narrative). 

**Ludus**
- rule-based games (Space Invaders!)
**Paidea**
- free-form games (GTA!) 

**Narratology:**
- the study of storytelling; the study of games as story systems.
- More useful: a typology of time and space

> *When you can classify, you can judge when/how/if a particular game/representation is suited to a particular purpose- or the purposes to which such a game is being put.*
- Space and time

**Alternate Reality Games** (*Perhaps the best mode for the historian?*)
- Games that take the computational power of video games and pushes it into the real world
- Clues littered into the movie poster..
- Alternate Reality Games - turn back to Ergodic Texts (scholarly or cultural)
 
 **Ergodic Texts**
  - you have to do work to understand the story
 
 *The I Love Bees Phenonmenon* [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNhurUnOWKQ) 
 
- An elaborate backstory & consuming narrative
- Series of transmedia puzzles and challenges to move the story forward
- Played in parallel to everyday reality; players become aware gradually of whatâs going on, form communities to unravel the story

**Tecumseh Lies Here**
- Game played by grad student

**Ethical issues**
- Is it right to screw with history this way?

**ARGS for History: The Killer App**

Of value to historians for:
- Immersive, authentic experience
- Have to think like a historian to succeed
- Allows multiple viewpoints, inhabit multiple viewpoints / perspectives
- Emergent meaning making

History and Video Games
- Understanding what is important and how it applies to video games. 
- Thinking about context and why we include things in video games? 
- Looking at video games that deem to be historically accurate
- Opposite of last week's lectures
- Playing the roman soldier Twine game with a partner and deconstructing it to understand IF the game is enjoyable, if it is accurate and what is the purpose of it (Path of Honours)

**Qs of mechanics to think about:
- are these actions reasonable in the context of this era?
- are these actions meaningful within the context of the game (do they carry consequences)?**
- When creating historically accurate games or games that we deem to be historical we must consider these two questions. 

**Qs of representation to think about when you play a 'historical' game:
- who is the villain?
- who is the hero?
- who matters to the story?
- who is left out?**
*We can relate these questions to not only video games but other areas of history. WE should apply this to all areas i.e public history, social history, when reading historical pieces etc
-For the purpose of this assignment however we need to be thinking wisely about the choices we are making
