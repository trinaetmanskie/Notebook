*Immersive experience with materials*
 What will you produce for this module? Unity...
 - Twine
 - Agumented Reality 
 
Agenda (today's lecture)

- defining a game
- how playfulness & history intersect
- playing the past
- categorizing immersive experiences *(the ones we are used to are the ones that we see because they are cateogrized for selling purposes- helps us to highlight what is important)*
- some video game theory
- ARGs the Killer App

> *Chris Crawford: Games are... the most ancient and time-honored vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one, having received the seal of approval of natural selection.*
- Quit because how upset he was with the industry
- Games and play are important for humans to learn anout the world
- Learning through play (think about ELECT curriculum) 
- You don't see lions lecturing their young at a chalkboard
- Games always have really bad press
- ALWAYS happen after a school shooting...
- How can use games for reaching people? In the 80's and 90's the literature is mainly positive
- Post Colombine..the literature becomes mainly **negative**
- Community play (context around which playing happens) is different than the game itself
- Games are models of exterial actions (game isn't real)
  - the player has to be able to feel something
  - **Conflict:** there must be a goal 
  - **Safety:** game play is safe, carry out the full consequences of the game (aka you get shot in the game and not in real life)
  - Video games can be ethical if you have realistic consequences (better than if you can just save and come back to the game) -ethical choices
  - *Do the choices that you make matter?*
   
  **FOR HISTORIANS THESE CHOICES HAVE TO MATTER**
 - WE ARE DEALING WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF REAL HUMAN BEINGS
  
 We have to think about these things when dealing with video games
 - Mechanics 
  - (basic rules and codes)
 - Dynamics 
  - (Algorithms, play)
 - Aesthetics 
  - (emotional response provoked provoked by player)
  
 Moving away from questions to what happened to rather WHY it happened? 
 - consequences emerge out of actions
 - contingency
 - equafinality (given the circumstances a set of outcomes are probable - and if all we have is the one true outcome that happened)
     - video games give you the options to change this
     - you can have many different possibilites
