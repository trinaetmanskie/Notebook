*Getting ready for Module 3..*

## Housekeeping

**Unity:** A landscape of the Ottawa River

- got topography from NASA and then put it into Unity
- [Unity Game](http://dhcu.ca/prairie-package-test/)

**Twinery:**
- you can use it to hack

**Python, Unity or Minecraft**

### Virtual Worlds of the Past:An Intro to Games/History

*Immersive experience with materials*
 What will you produce for this module? Unity...
 - Twine
 - Agumented Reality 
 
**Agenda (today's lecture)**
- defining a game
- how playfulness & history intersect
- playing the past
- categorizing immersive experiences *(the ones we are used to are the ones that we see because they are cateogrized for selling purposes- helps us to highlight what is important)*
- some video game theory
- ARGs the Killer App

> *Chris Crawford: Games are... the most ancient and time-honored vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one, having received the seal of approval of natural selection.*
- Quit because how upset he was with the industry
- Games and play are important for humans to learn anout the world
- Learning through play (think about ELECT curriculum) 
- You don't see lions lecturing their young at a chalkboard
- Games always have really bad press
- ALWAYS happen after a school shooting...
- How can use games for reaching people? In the 80's and 90's the literature is mainly positive
- Post Colombine..the literature becomes mainly **negative**
- Community play (context around which playing happens) is different than the game itself
- Games are models of exterial actions (game isn't real)
  - the player has to be able to feel something
  - **Conflict:** there must be a goal 
  - **Safety:** game play is safe, carry out the full consequences of the game (aka you get shot in the game and not in real life)
  - Video games can be ethical if you have realistic consequences (better than if you can just save and come back to the game) -ethical choices
  - *Do the choices that you make matter?*
   
  **FOR HISTORIANS THESE CHOICES HAVE TO MATTER**
 - WE ARE DEALING WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF REAL HUMAN BEINGS
  
 We have to think about these things when dealing with video games
 - Mechanics 
  - (basic rules and codes)
 - Dynamics 
  - (Algorithms, play)
 - Aesthetics 
  - (emotional response provoked provoked by player)
  
 Moving away from questions to what happened to rather WHY it happened? 
 - consequences emerge out of actions
 - contingency
 - equafinality (given the circumstances a set of outcomes are probable - and if all we have is the one true outcome that happened)
     - video games give you the options to change this
     - you can have many different possibilites
 
  *the ability to **play** out a scenario and then predict or write about what is happening*
   - the immersive experience changes how you deal with the source material in the first place
   
 **Why do we play games?**
- we are always asking "what happens next"
- pleasure of finding out what is going to happen next
   
   *an inversion of tense for historians..*
  
**In many ways, the same motivation for historians:**
- What happened then?
- Why did it happen?
- To play a game successfully, the gamer has to learn why things happen the way they do in order to win
- To be a successful historian, the historian has to learn why things happened the way they did

**[Youtube Video: Romans Must Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCe5QEnoioI)**

- *Simulation is the best tool for understanding context*
 - games where the player has control 
 - they have to now make the choices and decisions in these difficult sitations
 - **simulation is not an oracle**
 - its **interpretation** 
  - an interpretation that encourages further interpretation
- authority. **(SO important)**
- authoritative gravity of *print*

***BUT WITH GAMES. We can get past this***

#### Procedural Literacy & Procedural Rhetorics
- actual mechanics of the game are far more important than the graphics 
- graphics get in the way
- concern of the authenticity
- *is the layout of the cobble accurate for 18th c Boston?*
- argument about the world are encoded in the rule sets themselves
- creating scenarios that are realistic to that time
 - empiricism 
 - making scenarios that are realistic and reflect the scenario
 
**What (historical) games have you played?/ What made them historical?/ What made them good?**
- COD, Valiant Hearts
- Very few games about WWI
 - Harder to find out who the bad guys are 
- Far Cry Primal

**Ludology:**
- The study of games. Also: The study of games as a unique field, especially as distinct from narrative). 

**Ludus**
- rule-based games (Space Invaders!)
**Paidea**
- free-form games (GTA!) 

**Narratology:**
- the study of storytelling; the study of games as story systems.
- More useful: a typology of time and space

> *When you can classify, you can judge when/how/if a particular game/representation is suited to a particular purpose- or the purposes to which such a game is being put.*
- Space and time

**Alternate Reality Games** (*Perhaps the best mode for the historian?*)
- Games that take the computational power of video games and pushes it into the real world
- Clues littered into the movie poster..
- Alternate Reality Games - turn back to Ergodic Texts (scholarly or cultural)
 
 **Ergodic Texts**
  - you have to do work to understand the story
 
 *The I Love Bees Phenonmenon* [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNhurUnOWKQ) 
 
- An elaborate backstory & consuming narrative
- Series of transmedia puzzles and challenges to move the story forward
- Played in parallel to everyday reality; players become aware gradually of whatâs going on, form communities to unravel the story

**Tecumseh Lies Here**
- Game played by grad student

**Ethical issues**
- Is it right to screw with history this way?

**ARGS for History: The Killer App**

Of value to historians for:
- Immersive, authentic experience
- Have to think like a historian to succeed
- Allows multiple viewpoints, inhabit multiple viewpoints / perspectives
- Emergent meaning making
